Hello, I am Paul Brown. My aim is to reduce the friction customers experience with onboarding to a cloud platform and maximise the value they obtain through the use of Infrastructure Orchestration and Configuration Management tools.

I am employed by UKCloud as a Cloud Deployment Architect and the information in this blog is the personal opinion of the author, and does not necessarily reflect the opinions or position of UKCloud Limited.
