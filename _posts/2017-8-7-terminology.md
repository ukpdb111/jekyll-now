In the world of infrastructure provision and configuration two terms frequently used are Automation and Orchestration, it's important to understand what each of these terms means.

Automation is concerned with a single task, launching a database server, configuring a database server, stopping a service. 

Orchestration is the arrangement and coordination of automated tasks resulting in a consolidated workflow. 

For example to spin up an environment to host a new application many automated tasks will be required to deploy networks, security, instances/VMs, monitoring, management and there may also be OS configuration and this is where Orchestration is used to arrange and coordinate these tasks.
