In the world of infrastructure provision and configuration two terms frequently used are Automation and Orchestration, it's important to understand what each of these terms is referring to.

Automation is concerned with a single task, launching a database server, configuring a database server, stopping a service. 

Orchestration is the arrangement and coordination of automated tasks resulting in a consolidated workflow. 

For example to spin up an environment to host a new application many automated tasks will be required to deploy networks, security, instances/VMs, monitoring, management and there may also be OS configuration and this is where Orchestration is used to arrange and coordinate these tasks.
